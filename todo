# scene transitions
should make this a separate subpatch .. could handle this stuff like mute/solo ..
messages could be exculsive or not .. depending on whether we want to have different scenes playing at once
also, could these just be params, with some kind of mutex or crossfade property?

# refactoring
gemwindow should be wrapped with some macro that does dev/perf stuff
glitch might not be very useful anymore, slated for removal

# params
The ability to save a snapshot of the current vaules is important ... not sure if this
is more or less important than being able to set a snapshot, but I would like the ability
to save and load these things from a file, as hard coded messages seem to be kind of clunky
when there are a lot of messages.

possibly we shouldn't put the different animations in the params themselves.. not sure about this.


have params register themselves on creation? currently there isn't much of a way to manage all
the messages that come from teh params... they come in async and we'd like to have a row
per snapshot.

currently not worrying about file based snapshots. Current workflow is to just snap things to console and create 
messages from them manually to recall snapshots.

other things like animations maybe are more important.
look at tweening libraries

# lfo
need to wrap up modulation sources into lfo. Not sure if this means envelopes and animations also.
