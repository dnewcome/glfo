simplify scene cards
should be a way to make this easier and less repetitive


.. using signals for scene fades ..
should make this a separate subpatch .. could handle this stuff like mute/solo ..
messages could be exculsive or not .. depending on whether we want to have different scenes playing at once

one of the next things is to deal with snapshots ...
I'm thinking that I could have each param be an instance of a 'parameter' that is animatable and controllable ...
[probably we could use the same parameter idea for the scene transitions too
