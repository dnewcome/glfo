simplify scene cards
should be a way to make this easier and less repetitive


.. using signals for scene fades ..
should make this a separate subpatch .. could handle this stuff like mute/solo ..
messages could be exculsive or not .. depending on whether we want to have different scenes playing at once

one of the next things is to deal with snapshots ...

# refactoring
gem-window should probably take dimen and be wrapped with some macro that does dev/perf stuff
