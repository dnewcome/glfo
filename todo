simplify scene cards
should be a way to make this easier and less repetitive


.. using signals for scene fades ..
should make this a separate subpatch .. could handle this stuff like mute/solo ..
messages could be exculsive or not .. depending on whether we want to have different scenes playing at once

one of the next things is to deal with snapshots ...

# refactoring
gem-window should probably take dimen and be wrapped with some macro that does dev/perf stuff

# params
params are the fundamental mechanism of control for a scene..... we should be able to  some basic
things like set a param and send it a message for some different kinds of animations such as
linear fades and glitching

also, the ability to save a snapshot of the current vaules is important ... not sure if this
is more or less important than being able to set a snapshot, but I would like the ability
to save and load these things from a file, as hard coded messages seem to be kind of clunky
when there are a lot of messages.

possibly we shouldn't put the different animations in the params themselves.. not sure about this.


have params register themselves on creation? currently there isn't much of a way to manage all
the messages that come from teh params... they come in async and we'd like to have a row
per snapshot.

currently not worrying about file based snapshots. Current workflow is to just snap things to console and create 
messages from them manually to recall snapshots.

other things like animations maybe are more important.


# snapshots
maybe send an easy way for resetting the snapshot list instead of having to do it manually.

# blur
full scene blur. Can be done with shaders or pix2tex. 
Also per-card blur . Can be done using pix_snap. 

# framebuffers ..
using pix_snap vs using pix_snap2tex
snap2tex takes the toplevel framebuffer alwasys I think.. pix_snap allows us to use a framebuffer 
that isn't attached to the rendering pipleline. I want to be able to snapshot things that
aren't necessarily the final output of the system.

use pix_buffer to store snaps of individual scenes
maybe this could be a better way of doing the scene card thing

# rotate/translate for scene card
factor common scene translations into the card
