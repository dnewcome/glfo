# About

GLfo is a live video performance framework for the Pure Data/GEM programming language.

# Goals

GLfo aims to provide a comprehensive set of modulation sources useful for creating
interactive visual instruments. It also provides a framework for composing several 
scenes together into a live video performance set. 

# Requirements

GLfo is being tested under Pure Data Extended with the included GEM libraries. 
It is tested occasionally on PC versions of PD.

# Usage

Run live-set.pd with Pure Data to see a simple sample set.

# Installing

Clone the GLfo repository and add the path to the PD search paths.

# Future

* Performance improvements
* Scene stacks
* Centralized preset management
